vibe_sat is a command line SAT solver.

Options:
  --input=<filename>, -i <filename>
        SAT CNF file to read in. Required.

  --verbose=<integer>, -v <integer>
        Verbosity level. Default is 0.

  --algorithm=<string>, -a <string>
        Solving algorithm to use. Required. Supported values:
          hc   A basic hill-climb local search (STAGE2.md).
          ws   WalkSAT (STAGE4.md), a more advanced local search that
               can escape local optima that trap "hc".
          dfs  A complete depth-first search using unit propagation
               (STAGE5.md). Unlike "hc"/"ws", dfs can prove UNSAT: it
               reports "UNSAT" (not "UNKNOWN") when the search space
               is exhausted without finding a solution.

  --output=<filename>, -o <filename>
        Where to write a satisfying solution, in DIMACS solution
        format. If not given, the solution is printed to the screen
        when --verbose is at least 1; otherwise it is not written
        anywhere.

  --time-limit-secs=<integer>, -t <integer>
        Optional time limit, in seconds, for the search. Required by
        "hc"/"ws" unless --alg-params is given instead; optional for
        "dfs" (which will otherwise run until it finds a solution or
        exhausts the search space, however long that takes).

  --alg-params <val1> [<val2> <val3>], -p <val1> [<val2> <val3>]
        Algorithm-specific parameters (1 to 3 integer values); at
        least one of --alg-params or --time-limit-secs is required for
        "hc"/"ws". The meaning of each value depends on --algorithm:
          hc   val1 = number of random restarts to perform.
          ws   val1 = number of random restarts ("tries") to perform.
               val2 = max flips per try before giving up and starting
                      a new try (default 10000 if omitted).
               val3 = noise percent, 0-100: the chance of flipping a
                      uniformly random variable of the chosen
                      unsatisfied clause instead of the one that
                      breaks the fewest other clauses (default 50 if
                      omitted).
               Values are positional: to set val2 or val3 you must
               also supply every value before it.
          dfs  val1 = which SelectVar heuristic to use (STAGE6.md):
                 0 = the default weighted heuristic from STAGE5.md
                     (looks at every not-yet-satisfied clause on every
                     node; more expensive, tends to keep the search
                     tree smaller).
                 1 = a cheap static-order heuristic that just picks
                     the lowest-numbered unassigned variable, looking
                     at no clause contents at all; much faster per
                     node, but tends to grow the search tree.
               Optional; defaults to 0 if --alg-params is not given.

  --no-preprocessing, -x
        Skip preprocessing (STAGE8.md: unit propagation, pure literal
        elimination, subsumption elimination, and bounded variable
        elimination), and hand the CNF file to the chosen algorithm
        exactly as read. Preprocessing runs by default; this flag
        takes no value.

  --help, -h
        Print this help message and exit.
